Good morning Group B.

_Code & Project Review
Good job on the User Interface, I believe you are fixing the navigation of the app as I currently don't have access to other pages

Suggestion#1: refrain from using magic strings which is a "direct usage of a String in the code", e.g in the fetch(), it would be better to declare a variable called URL and instantiate it with the url link then add it as a parameter in the fetch, rather than fetch("abcc").
